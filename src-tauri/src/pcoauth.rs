//! Signing in to Planning Center the official way: OAuth 2.0 authorization
//! code with PKCE.
//!
//! What this replaces. ProDeck's original path was a **Personal Access
//! Token** — an Application ID and Secret that a church admin creates on the
//! developer site and pastes in. It works, but it is the wrong shape for an
//! app handed to other churches:
//!
//! - The secret is a long-lived password sitting in `settings.json`, in every
//!   backup bundle, and in whatever the admin pasted it out of.
//! - It carries that person's *entire* Planning Center access. There is no
//!   scope, so a token for reading the Sunday plan can also read Giving.
//! - Nothing in Planning Center shows it is in use, and revoking it means
//!   hunting for the right row on the developer site.
//! - It takes an eight-step detour through a developer site that most worship
//!   pastors have never seen, which is where new churches gave up.
//!
//! OAuth fixes all four: the operator clicks **Connect**, signs in on Planning
//! Center's own page, and approves ProDeck for the `services` and `people`
//! products only. ProDeck stores an access token that dies in two hours and a
//! refresh token it rotates, and the church can see and revoke the connection
//! from their Planning Center account. No password of theirs is ever typed
//! into ProDeck or stored by it.
//!
//! Why PKCE and no client secret. A desktop app cannot keep a secret — anyone
//! who downloads the DMG has the bytes. Planning Center calls that a *public*
//! application and requires PKCE for it (their docs: "we recommend PKCE for
//! confidential apps and require it for public apps"). So ProDeck registers a
//! public app, ships only the client id (not a secret, by design), and proves
//! at the token exchange that the program finishing the flow is the one that
//! started it. Nothing in this file is confidential.
//!
//! Why a loopback redirect. Planning Center sends the browser back to a URL
//! the application registered. ProDeck listens on 127.0.0.1 for exactly one
//! request, for at most five minutes, and only while a sign-in is in flight —
//! it is not a server. That keeps the authorization code on the operator's own
//! machine; it never crosses the internet to prodeck.live or anywhere else.
//! The PAT path is untouched and still works; see `pco::auth`.
