# Publish a public ProDeck release: the drag-to-install DMG PLUS the signed
# auto-update artifact, as one GitHub Release. Every installed copy checks
# .../releases/latest/download/latest.json at launch, so publishing here is
# what pushes the new version to everyone who downloaded the app.

# Steps: bump "version" in src-tauri/tauri.conf.json first (tag = v<version>).

# Needs:
#   ~/.prodeck/public-updater.key   the PUBLIC-release signing key (passwordless).
#                                   Its public half is baked into tauri.conf.json;
#                                   the app refuses updates signed by anything else.
#                                   BACK IT UP — losing it strands every install on
#                                   its current version until they re-download.

# The Windows installer is BUILT by GitHub Actions (this is a Mac) and SIGNED
# here, because the minisign key never leaves this machine. Set SKIP_WINDOWS=1
# to publish macOS-only — Windows copies then simply see no update, which is
# the same as before this existed. Needs the release commit pushed: CI builds
# what's on the remote, not your working copy.
#
# One signed app is used for BOTH the DMG and the updater tarball, so what a
# new downloader gets and what an updater installs are byte-identical.

Download **$(basename "$WIN_EXE")** and run it. It installs for the current user only, so there's no admin prompt. Installed copies update themselves from this release automatically.

**First run only:** Windows SmartScreen will say *Windows protected your PC*, because the installer isn't yet signed with a Microsoft-recognised certificate. Click **More info → Run anyway**. That is the error, not a fault in the download.
